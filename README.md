How to run:

1. split terminal
2. type `pnpm run db` to start the backend

Notes:
For the images, i use personal Cloudinary. the reason is because it is easy to store the images and i can get the image url easily. **Be careful** what image you upload because i can see it in my cloudinary dashboard.

I did not deploy the application since the **backend won't work properly because of json-server can't be deployed**.
